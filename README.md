# MAAA_Front-end

How to run (*note Components from M3dicine's private NPM repo have been utilised so user must have access to run **current version just utilising icons so can be removed)

cd maaa-frontend

npm install

npm start

Patient functionality works including all server communication

File upload works

Audio visualisation works.

User authentication is incorporated into server communication, however tokens are currently hard coded into state as login page does not communicate with server.

Annotations (react-waves regions is currently static, dynamic creation/deletion of regions is not functional, however modification of current regions is *potentially problems with outdated github repo) 

Consider WebAudio API
